# Get the information about any GitHub User!üîç

This is the bakcend of the **Fullstack App** which uses GitHub API under the hood to get the data of the user one searches for

### Technologies Used üë©‚Äçüíª

In the frontend part of the app, the technologies used are as follows:

- NodeJS - As the environment for building the backend
- ExpressJS - For building the backend of this app ([backend repo](https://github.com/Lordhacker756/FyleBackend)üîó)
- GitHub API - To get the user information
- Axios - To fetch the data

### What I got to learn from this project üí°

Here are the most important points I learnt while building the frontend of this app

- Having a proper folder structure and documentation that is both developer friendly and scaleable.
- Creating controllers in backend made using ExpressJS
- Using Axios to fetch data
- GitHub - To properly maintain the codebase, and have the ability to rollback in case of any error.
